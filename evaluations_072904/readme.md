The evaluations of annotator1 are split because there was an unknown problem during the task and the annotator had to finish the evaluation using a different file; the first file, which contained 35 annotated items, was saved with a different name so that it could not be overwritten, and the evaluator started the whole evaluation process over, skipping the first 35 evaluation items (always choosing system A). We combined the two files when processing the results.
